Preliminary Stack Diagram of classes

Background and Context:

We want to create a point and click mouse controlled computer game using Pygame library and original art, inspired by early video games and newer visual novels. The game will be set on a spaceship, with the player experiencing the scene in first person with the astronaut’s visor screen displaying their vital signs at the edges of the screen. The game will begin with the player waking up alone on the spacecraft with a leak in their oxygen supply, and the ship is a decaying orbit of a distant star. The object of the game will be to collect the necessary items and complete certain actions in the right order to repair the ship before the oxygen runs out.

Key Questions:

Do you feel that our story concept is fun and engaging?
Is our game complex enough to take the whole 6 weeks?
Should our classes be more specific so that there is a class for each type of object in the game?
Would you prefer a funny parody or serious adventure more intriguing?
